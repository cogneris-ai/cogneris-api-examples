/*
 * Cogneris Document AI API
 * The Cogneris Document AI API turns unstructured documents — PDFs, images, scans — into structured JSON.  This document describes the endpoints that are actually deployed. It is written from the running service (`cogneris-api-be`) rather than from a design, so what is listed here is what you can call.  ## Authentication  Every endpoint takes an API key in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <key>`. Keys begin with `xtkt_live_` (production) or `xtkt_test_` (sandbox); either prefix is accepted before the key is looked up for validation. The key selects the application environment. A recognized prefix alone does not authenticate a request: the key must also be valid and active. Keys are tenant-scoped and cannot cross tenant boundaries. Mint them in the dashboard under **Settings → API keys**.  ## Uploads  The synchronous document endpoints take `multipart/form-data`. There is no fetch-by-URL variant — the file travels in the request body.  - Accepted extensions: `.pdf`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.tiff`, `.tif`,   `.bmp`, `.doc`, `.docx` - Maximum size: 10 MB per file, except `/Document/split`, which accepts 500 MB  The asynchronous job endpoints do not take a file. Upload it first to `POST /api/v1/artifacts` — same extensions, same 10 MB limit — and submit the `artifact://` reference it returns.  ## Artifact references  A reference names one stored object. `POST /api/v1/artifacts` returns one, a job submit consumes one as `inputReference`, and a finished job returns one as `outputReference`. `GET /api/v1/artifacts/content` turns either back into bytes.  - References are scoped to the tenant that created them. One belonging to another   tenant is refused as an invalid reference — the answer does not distinguish a   reference that exists elsewhere from one that never existed. - An uploaded reference is **reusable**: one upload can back several jobs. - It expires **7 days** after upload, matching how long a job is retained. The   exact instant is returned as `expiresAt`. Reading it afterwards answers `410`,   which is not `404` — the reference was real, it aged out, and re-requesting it   will never succeed. Upload again. - A job's `outputReference` lives as long as the job does.  ### Two shapes, one of them historical  Everything this API produces today is `artifact://<key>`. Jobs that completed before 2026-09-22 carry a bucket-qualified path instead — `<bucket>/<tenant>/document-jobs/<jobId>/result.json`, sometimes with an `@<version>` suffix. `GET /api/v1/artifacts/content` accepts both, so a reference stored from an older job still resolves for the rest of its life. Treat a reference as opaque: pass back exactly what you were given.  ## Templates  Extraction and classification are driven by the document types and templates configured for your tenant. The platform selects the template from the document itself, so the synchronous `/Document/_*` calls take no template or schema parameter. Use `GET /api/v1/templates` to list the finished templates available to your key before naming one explicitly with `templateId` on `POST /api/v1/document-jobs`. The list is cursor-paginated; pass its `nextCursor` as `cursor` to read the next page.  ## Scopes  Keys carry scopes. The Portal and webhook-endpoint routes check them and answer `403` when the required one is absent; the document endpoints accept any valid key for the tenant without consulting the list. `*` is a real scope meaning full access, and it is what a key receives when it is created without an explicit scope list.  ## Webhooks  A finished asynchronous job can announce itself, so you do not have to poll it. Register an HTTPS endpoint with `POST /api/v1/webhook-endpoints` and it receives a signed `POST` when a job you subscribed to succeeds, fails or is cancelled. The webhook **announces** the result and does not carry it: read the bytes with `GET /api/v1/artifacts/content?reference=<OutputReference>`.  Endpoints are managed with a **production** key holding `webhooks.manage` (or `*`). An endpoint receives your whole account's production events for the events it subscribes to, and events from sandbox jobs are never delivered, so a sandbox key is refused.  Each delivery carries three headers:  - `X-Xtrakt-Event` — the event name, such as `extract.processed`. - `X-Xtrakt-Delivery` — a fresh id per send. It is not a deduplication key. - `X-Xtrakt-Signature` — `t=<unix seconds>,v1=<hex>`, where `v1` is the   HMAC-SHA256 of `<t>.<raw body>` keyed with the endpoint's `whsec_` secret.   Recompute it over the raw bytes, compare in constant time, and reject a `t`   outside your tolerance.  For a job, the body is the job's terminal state. **Its property names are PascalCase**, unlike the rest of this API:  ```json {\"JobId\":\"7c9e6679-7425-40de-944b-e07fc1f90ae7\",\"Operation\":\"Extraction\",  \"Status\":\"succeeded\",\"OutputReference\":\"artifact://document-jobs/7c9e6679-7425-40de-944b-e07fc1f90ae7/result.json\",  \"Stage\":null,\"ProcessedPages\":null,\"TotalPages\":null,\"FailureCode\":null,  \"AttemptCount\":1,\"CompletedAt\":\"2026-09-23T14:02:11.482Z\"} ```  `Status` is `succeeded`, `failed` or `cancelled`, and a cancelled job sends the `.failed` event. `OutputReference` is null unless the job succeeded, and always null for `Redaction`. The synchronous `/Document/_*` calls fire the same event names with their own response as the body; a delivery about a job is the one that has `JobId`. An endpoint with a `body` sends that fixed text **instead of** the payload.  Delivery semantics:  - **A job's outcome never depends on its webhook.** A job that succeeded stays   succeeded when the delivery fails; `GET /api/v1/document-jobs/{jobId}` is the   source of truth. - **One attempt per endpoint, no retry.** A timeout or a non-2xx answer is   recorded and not sent again. Answer `2xx` fast and do the work afterwards, and   reconcile periodically with `GET /api/v1/document-jobs`. - **Duplicates are rare but possible.** Deduplicate on `JobId` plus the event. - Every delivery attempt is metered as webhook usage, successful or not.  ## Rate limits  One shared policy covers every surface in this document, Portal included: **50 requests per API key per fixed 1-minute window**. It is a fixed window rather than a token bucket, so the allowance resets on the minute instead of refilling gradually. Requests over the limit receive `429`.  ## Response envelope  Successful responses from the **document, job and webhook-endpoint** routes share one wrapper: `data` for the payload, `meta` for the status and any messages, and `hasErrors` for a fast failure check. The webhook-endpoint routes send their **errors** as problem documents, described next.  The **Portal** endpoints do not use that wrapper. They return the payload directly, and their errors are RFC 9457 problem documents sent as `application/problem+json`, with a stable `code`, a `correlationId` that is also returned in the `x-correlation-id` header, and a `retryable` flag. Branch on `code`; treat `type` as an opaque identifier.  ## Errors  An error arrives in one of two shapes, and the `Content-Type` says which.  - `application/problem+json` — an RFC 9457 problem document, the same one the   Portal uses. Every route answers this way when the failure happens before your   request is processed: a missing or invalid key (`401`), the rate limit (`429`),   a request refused as malformed or unsafe (`400`), or an unexpected failure   (`500`). - `application/json` — the service envelope with `hasErrors: true` and the   reasons in `meta.errors`. The document, job and artifact routes answer this way   when processing itself fails. Each operation lists the statuses where it does.  Every operation lists `400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `409`, `429` and `500`, because the API answers each of them in the same shape wherever it occurs. A status on an operation with nothing to miss or conflict with — a `409` on a read, say — is part of that uniform model and not something the operation returns in practice.
