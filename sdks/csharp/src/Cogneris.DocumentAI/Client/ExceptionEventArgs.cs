 * Cogneris Document AI API
 *
 * The Cogneris Document AI API turns unstructured documents — PDFs, images, scans — into structured JSON.  This document describes the endpoints that are actually deployed. It is written from the running service (`cogneris-api-be`) rather than from a design, so what is listed here is what you can call.  ## Authentication  Every endpoint takes an API key in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <key>`. Keys begin with `xtkt_live_` (production) or `xtkt_test_` (sandbox); either prefix is accepted before the key is looked up for validation. The key selects the application environment. A recognized prefix alone does not authenticate a request: the key must also be valid and active. Keys are tenant-scoped and cannot cross tenant boundaries. Mint them in the dashboard under **Settings → API keys**.  ## Uploads  The synchronous document endpoints take `multipart/form-data`. There is no fetch-by-URL variant — the file travels in the request body.  - Accepted extensions: `.pdf`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.tiff`, `.tif`,   `.bmp`, `.doc`, `.docx` - Maximum size: 10 MB per file, except `/Document/split`, which accepts 500 MB  The asynchronous job endpoints do not take a file. Upload it first to `POST /api/v1/artifacts` — same extensions, same 10 MB limit — and submit the `artifact://` reference it returns.  ## Artifact references  A reference names one stored object. `POST /api/v1/artifacts` returns one, a job submit consumes one as `inputReference`, and a finished job returns one as `outputReference`. `GET /api/v1/artifacts/content` turns either back into bytes.  - References are scoped to the tenant that created them. One belonging to another   tenant is refused as an invalid reference — the answer does not distinguish a   reference that exists elsewhere from one that never existed. - An uploaded reference is **reusable**: one upload can back several jobs. - It expires **7 days** after upload, matching how long a job is retained. The   exact instant is returned as `expiresAt`. Reading it afterwards answers `410`,   which is not `404` — the reference was real, it aged out, and re-requesting it   will never succeed. Upload again. - A job's `outputReference` lives as long as the job does.  ### Two shapes, one of them historical  Everything this API produces today is `artifact://<key>`. Jobs that completed before 2026-09-22 carry a bucket-qualified path instead — `<bucket>/<tenant>/document-jobs/<jobId>/result.json`, sometimes with an `@<version>` suffix. `GET /api/v1/artifacts/content` accepts both, so a reference stored from an older job still resolves for the rest of its life. Treat a reference as opaque: pass back exactly what you were given.  ## Templates  Extraction and classification are driven by the document types and templates configured for your tenant. The platform selects the template from the document itself, so the synchronous `/Document/_*` calls take no template or schema parameter. An asynchronous Extraction job may instead name one explicitly with `templateId` on `POST /api/v1/document-jobs`.  ## Scopes  Keys carry scopes. The Portal endpoints check them and answer `403` when the required one is absent; the document endpoints accept any valid key for the tenant without consulting the list. `*` is a real scope meaning full access, and it is what a key receives when it is created without an explicit scope list.  ## Rate limits  One shared policy covers every surface in this document, Portal included: **50 requests per API key per fixed 1-minute window**. It is a fixed window rather than a token bucket, so the allowance resets on the minute instead of refilling gradually. Requests over the limit receive `429`.  ## Response envelope  Successful responses from the **document and job** endpoints share one wrapper: `data` for the payload, `meta` for the status and any messages, and `hasErrors` for a fast failure check.  The **Portal** endpoints do not use that wrapper. They return the payload directly, and their errors are RFC 9457 problem documents sent as `application/problem+json`, with a stable `code`, a `correlationId` that is also returned in the `x-correlation-id` header, and a `retryable` flag. Branch on `code`; treat `type` as an opaque identifier.  ## Errors  An error arrives in one of two shapes, and the `Content-Type` says which.  - `application/problem+json` — an RFC 9457 problem document, the same one the   Portal uses. Every route answers this way when the failure happens before your   request is processed: a missing or invalid key (`401`), the rate limit (`429`),   a request refused as malformed or unsafe (`400`), or an unexpected failure   (`500`). - `application/json` — the service envelope with `hasErrors: true` and the   reasons in `meta.errors`. The document, job and artifact routes answer this way   when processing itself fails. Each operation lists the statuses where it does.  Every operation lists `400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `409`, `429` and `500`, because the API answers each of them in the same shape wherever it occurs. A status on an operation with nothing to miss or conflict with — a `409` on a read, say — is part of that uniform model and not something the operation returns in practice.
